# Solving ODEs in Matlab  

#For:
   Duke Mathematical Biology Workshop 2015  
  
#Explains:
   1. How integration tolerances effect integration times
   2. How to repeatedly integrate a system of ODEs with differnt parameter values
   3. Practical issues somewhat specific to MATLAB solvers
  
#Contains:
  Three models and one script
